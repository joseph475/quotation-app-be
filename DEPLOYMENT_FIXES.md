# Deployment Fixes for SIGTERM Issues

## Problem
The application was starting successfully but getting terminated with SIGTERM signal, causing deployment failures.

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Database Connection Timing**: Database connection was not properly awaited before server startup
2. **Health Check Issues**: Health checks were not robust enough for deployment platforms
3. **Signal Handling**: Inadequate graceful shutdown handling
4. **Platform Configuration**: Missing health check configuration in nixpacks.toml

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Server.js Improvements

#### Database Connection
- Added proper async/await for database connection
- Added connection state tracking with `dbConnected` flag
- Database connection failure now properly exits the process

#### Health Check Endpoints
- **`/health`**: Returns 200 for healthy, 503 for unhealthy
- **`/ready`**: New readiness probe endpoint
- Both endpoints check database connection state

#### Graceful Shutdown
- Improved SIGTERM/SIGINT handling with timeout
- Added uncaught exception and unhandled rejection handlers
- 10-second timeout for graceful shutdown
- Proper cleanup of HTTP server and MongoDB connections

### 2. Database Configuration (config/database.js)
- Added connection pooling options
- Reduced connection timeouts for faster failure detection
- Added connection event handlers for better monitoring
- Disabled mongoose buffering for immediate error feedback

### 3. Nixpacks Configuration
- Added health check configuration:
  - Path: `/health`
  - Interval: 30 seconds
  - Timeout: 10 seconds
  - Retries: 3
  - Start period: 60 seconds

### 4. Testing Tools
- Created `deploy-test.js` for testing deployment endpoints
- Added npm scripts: `test-deploy` and `test-local`

## Key Configuration Changes

### nixpacks.toml
```toml
[healthcheck]
path = '/health'
interval = 30
timeout = 10
retries = 3
start_period = 60
```

### Database Options
```javascript
const options = {
  useNewUrlParser: true,
  useUnifiedTopology: true,
  maxPoolSize: 10,
  serverSelectionTimeoutMS: 5000,
  socketTimeoutMS: 45000,
  bufferMaxEntries: 0,
  bufferCommands: false,
};
```

## Testing the Deployment

### Local Testing
```bash
npm run test-local
```

### Production Testing
```bash
npm run test-deploy https://your-deployment-url.com
```

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

1. **Startup**: Server waits for database connection before accepting requests
2. **Health Checks**: Platform can properly monitor application health
3. **Graceful Shutdown**: Application handles SIGTERM properly with cleanup
4. **Error Handling**: Better error reporting and recovery

## Monitoring

The application now provides better logging for:
- Database connection status
- Health check responses
- Graceful shutdown process
- Error conditions

## Next Steps

1. Deploy with the updated configuration
2. Monitor logs for successful startup sequence:
   - "Database connection established"
   - "Server running on port X"
   - "Server started successfully - keeping alive"
3. Test health endpoints after deployment
4. Monitor for SIGTERM issues in logs

## Troubleshooting

If SIGTERM issues persist:

1. Check MongoDB connection string and credentials
2. Verify network connectivity to MongoDB
3. Check deployment platform resource limits
4. Review health check logs in deployment platform
5. Test endpoints manually using the deploy-test script

## Health Check Endpoints

- **GET /**: Basic API status
- **GET /health**: Comprehensive health check (database + uptime)
- **GET /ready**: Readiness probe (database connection)

All endpoints return JSON responses with appropriate HTTP status codes.
